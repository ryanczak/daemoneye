**Active milestone: M26 — Agent isolation on Docker Sandboxes (sbx)**,
[`milestones/M26-sbx-isolation/README.md`](milestones/M26-sbx-isolation/README.md).
Rescoped 2026-10-05 from "tmux removal & 2.0 close" (now **M27**; later
milestones are M28–M30, `docs/design/daemoneye-2.0.md` § 6). **PE signed off
on scope 2026-10-05**, accepting all six recommendations.

**Active phase: none drafted.** Phases 01–03, 04a/b, 05a–c and 06a–c are
**done** (06c: a sandboxed local ghost runs in its own sbx sandbox, torn down at
exit; startup sweep). Next is row **06d — sbx-script-stage** (Q3);
`/rexymcp:architect next` drafts it. The 06c live check is deferred to the row-10
live close.

Carried from M23 into M26: the sandboxed ghost in a PTY shell (now sbx, with
in-VM `Ctrl-p`); the `ghost-shell-guide` memory rewrite; pause-vs-deadline
(decided: a pause suspends the deadline). M23's two fold proposals remain on
the calibration queue.
