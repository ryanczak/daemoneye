# NEXT

**Active milestone:** **M3 — Polish & Maintenance** (kicked off 2026-06-27). Goal: pay
down post-M2 debt — correctness/hermeticity bugs, user-facing rough edges, and codebase
health — with no behavior regressions. Open design scope (breaking wire/format/architecture
changes flagged per-phase for PE sign-off). See
`docs/dev/milestones/M3-polish-maintenance/README.md` for the phase plan and survey basis.

**Active phase:** **phase-08 — help-and-truncation** (`todo`, drafted 2026-06-28). Doc:
`docs/dev/milestones/M3-polish-maintenance/phase-08-help-and-truncation.md`. Dispatch it
with `/rexymcp:dispatch phase-08`.

Phase-08 scope (ux, `src/cli/render_ratatui.rs` + `src/cli/commands/chat.rs`): add `…`
markers to three silent-truncation render paths (status-bar session id ×3, panel body
lines, committed scrollback) via two pure char-count helpers (`truncate_with_ellipsis`,
`short_session`); and complete `/help` by extracting the text to a testable
`const HELP_TEXT` and documenting the recognized aliases, the approval-prompt message
redirect, and the 10-line tool-output cap. Char-count truncation is preserved (no
unicode-width dep). ~110 lines incl. ~5 unit tests. No protocol/format change.

The remaining M3 phases are recorded as `todo` rows in the M3 README phase table and are drafted on
demand via `/rexymcp:architect next` after each prior phase is approved.

**M3 phase-07 — split-webhook is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Split the
1210-line `webhook.rs` grab-bag into a `webhook/` directory module with three cohesive
submodules (`parse` / `process` / `server`) via the M2 C5-split idiom; glob re-exports keep
every `crate::webhook::<name>` path resolving, zero consumer edits. Only non-move edit:
`AlertStatus::as_str` `fn` → `pub(crate) fn`. Executor commit `d8aba17`; review approval `e125eae`.

**M3 phase-06 — error-hardening is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Three
behavior-preserving hardening edits: `memory_prompt.rs` double-lookup → single Entry-API
expression; four `ai/mod.rs` circuit-breaker lock sites → documented `.unwrap_or_log()`
invariant (ERROR-on-poison logging); five `daemon/scheduled.rs` swallowed `notify_tx` sends →
`log::debug!` on dropped receiver. Executor commit `e7a1658`; review approval `b040651`.

**M3 phase-05 — consolidate-leaf-params is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28).
Introduced per-function borrow-structs (`UpdateMemoryArgs`, `SaveSessionArgs`, `RunEditArgs`,
`UpdateMemoryRequest`, `CreateAgentArgs`) resolving 5 of the 7 `TODO(M2)` markers and deleting
their `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` suppressions. Executor commit `822ba7f`; review
approval `e89255e`.

**M3 phase-04 — error-message-quality is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Killed the
`render_error` `{:?}` debug-dump leak via an exhaustive `Response::kind()` label method + a pure
`error_line()` formatter (`unexpected reply from daemon (<Kind>)`), and normalized the
`/session list` + `/prompt` empty-state strings. Executor commit `77ee226`; review approval `1b9d22f`.

**M3 phase-03 — split-utils is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Split the 1007-line
`src/daemon/utils.rs` grab-bag into a `daemon/utils/` directory of cohesive submodules with
`pub use <submod>::*;` re-exports preserving every `crate::daemon::utils::<name>` path. Executor
commit `bc4b76f`; review approval `4a69f1e`.

**M3 phase-02 — approval-prompt-consistency is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-27).
Unified the three interactive approval prompts through a shared `build_approval_prompt()`
builder, canonicalizing on `[Y]es [A]pprove for <label> [N]o`. Executor commit `d4097a6`;
review approval `5726f15`.

**M3 phase-01 — fix-test-hermeticity is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-27). Converted the
racy `webhook_alert_to_event_log` to a sync `#[test]` driving its one async call via `rt.block_on`
(holds `TEST_HOME_LOCK` for the whole body, restores `HOME`), and added `HOME` capture/restore to
the five leak tests. Executor commit `c52608f`; review approval `ce7c650`. 15× concurrency soak clean.

**M2 — TUI Renderer Overhaul is complete** (2026-06-27; all 16 phases `done`). Retrospective in
`docs/dev/milestones/M2-tui-renderer/README.md`. The M2 calibration fold (front-loading made
task-shape-conditional + milestone-gate clarification) landed in WORKFLOW.md (commit `70e9712`).

**M1 — Agent Tooling Improvements is complete** — all eleven phases `done`; retrospective in
`docs/dev/milestones/M1-agent-tooling/README.md`.
