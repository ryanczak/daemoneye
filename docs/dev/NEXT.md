**Active phase:
[M11 phase-01 — write-time-masking](milestones/M11-knowledge-index/phase-01-write-time-masking.md)
(`in-progress` — bounced at review 2026-08-03, see
[bug-01-1](milestones/M11-knowledge-index/bugs/bug-01-1.md)).** The
implementation is correct and verified; the bounce is on the missing
end-to-end verification artifact and the home-guard idiom in two tests.
Re-dispatch with `/rexymcp:dispatch phase-01-write-time-masking`.

**M11 — Unified Knowledge Index scoped 2026-08-03** (PE decision). Seven phases
planned; design settled in `docs/design/knowledge-index.md`; milestone README at
`docs/dev/milestones/M11-knowledge-index/README.md`.

**M10 — Residual Hygiene closed 2026-08-02** (three phases, all
`approved_first_try`, zero bugs, zero bounces). Retrospective:
`docs/dev/milestones/M10-residual-hygiene/README.md`.

## The carried list is empty except for one unreproducible item

1. **`hooks_land_on_private_server`** — the old phase-04-review flake. Binds no
   ports; **0 failures in 300 runs** across M8, M9 and M10. No evidence to work
   from. Only a bug if it recurs.

Everything else carried out of M7 and M8 is closed: the tty tests fail instead of
hanging, the memory category→directory mapping is derived in all three callers,
the last real-clock sleep is gone, and `daemoneye reindex` is documented and gated.

## One calibration item, resolved at close

The executor mislabelled its own model in its Update Log entry three times (M9
phase-01, M10 phase-01, M10 phase-03) — it is Qwen3.6-27B-FP8 every time. Three
occurrences hit the fold threshold, and the PE's decision was to drop the model
line from the executor's own entry.

**Applying it revealed the premise was wrong: no template asks for that line.**
`docs/dev/WORKFLOW.md` § "Update Log entries" defines progress, blocker and
completion entries, and none has an `**Executor:**` field. The only one in the
file is at `:347` in the **Review verdict** template — the architect's line, which
has been correct throughout. The embedded executor contract does not request it
either.

The executor adds it unprompted, so there is nothing to delete and no fold to
file. The operative consequence is for review: **an unrequested, self-reported
model name in an executor entry is not a defect against any spec, and should not
be corrected in place.** It was corrected three times on the assumption it was
contract-mandated.

Actively suppressing it would mean editing `executor/templates/executor_contract.md`
in the **rexyMCP** repo — out of bounds from a target-project architect session.

## The rules M7–M10 earned

> **Do not assert a fact about the system in a spec unless it was executed.**
> A *claimed failure mode* is such a fact — M9 justified a test with a
> compile-time impossibility one `cargo build` would have disproven.
>
> **A criterion about the tree the phase will produce must be validated against
> that tree**, not the one in front of you. Calibrating against the current tree
> catches unsatisfiable criteria; it does not catch criteria the phase's own work
> invalidates, or criteria that already pass without the work being done.
>
> **Prototype the change and mutate it before writing the spec.** M10 phase 02's
> real risk — two labels with no test, where a swap left 1036 tests green — was
> invisible until the prototype was mutated.
>
> **An acceptance criterion for an intermittent failure must be a repeat count
> derived from a measured rate.** A single green run is not evidence.
>
> **Measure through the same door the user will use.** M9's in-process probe of
> `reconcile_index()` recorded a bare-`$HOME` result the shipped binary never
> produces.

Corollaries, each earned more than once: naming a false-success mode is worthless
unless the guard is checked against it; a phase that lands code for a *later*
phase must say how the deny-warnings gate is satisfied; and **a green bounce
always needs a refined re-dispatch**, never a plain one.
