**Active phase:**
[`docs/dev/milestones/M4-context-management/phase-02-token-estimation.md`](milestones/M4-context-management/phase-02-token-estimation.md)
— **todo**, re-validated 2026-07-13, ready for
`/rexymcp:dispatch phase-02-token-estimation`.

**Phase-02 re-validation (2026-07-13).** Current-state anchors re-checked
against the working tree after phase-01 landed — all hold: `Message`
`wire.rs:20`, `SessionEntry` `session.rs:21` / `last_prompt_tokens` `:34`,
`stream.rs` calibration sites `663`/`793`, `server/ask.rs` compaction read
`236` + `token_pct` `256` + `PromptCtx` pass-through `505` + `or_insert_with`
`106`; no `daemon/context/` module yet. One fix: the Spec §2 construction-site
list gained a 7th site (`executor/mod.rs:1075`, a ghost test constructor) and a
note that `SessionEntry` has no serde derive (no `#[serde(default)]` shortcut).

**M4 phase-01 — events-rotation is `done`** (2026-07-09, escalated → session
takeover after 1 bounce; committed `3d74880`). Executor implemented the phase +
bug fixes but looped on the bug-01-3 test verification (120+ turns grepping test
stdout); the architect finished it in the main loop — extracted
`aggregate_over_range()` for a real cost-sort test (bug-01-1), corrected the
search-tail test query (bug-01-3), and ran both real-binary E2E scenarios
(bug-01-2). All three bugs `verified`; gates green (862 unit + 27 integration).

**M4 — Context Management Overhaul is scoped** (2026-07-07, PE sign-off). The
design is `docs/design/context-management.md` (failure catalog D1–D15 + target
architecture); the milestone README with all ten phase rows is
`docs/dev/milestones/M4-context-management/README.md`. All ten phase docs were
drafted at kick-off by explicit PE request — **re-verify each doc's Current
state section against the working tree before dispatching it** (earlier phases
move its anchors; each doc carries a Pre-flight step for this).

Phase order: 01 events-rotation → 02 token-estimation → 03 budget-compaction →
04 append-only-archive → 05 epoch-records → 06 ledger-rollups →
07 recall-context → 08 async-compaction → 09 session-meta-persistence →
10 ghost-and-memory.

**M3 — Polish & Maintenance is complete** (2026-06-28; all 10 phases `done`,
all `approved_first_try`, zero bounces, zero bug reports). Retrospective in
`docs/dev/milestones/M3-polish-maintenance/README.md` § Retrospective. All seven
M3 exit criteria met; no STANDARDS.md / WORKFLOW.md folds this milestone (M3 was
all maintenance-shaped work that confirmed existing folds rather than revealing
new patterns). The two M3 survey holdovers (error-result/response-builder
helper ~74 sites; executor approval-gate extraction) remain deferred.

**M3 phase-09 — consolidate-loop-ctx is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28).
Consolidated the two remaining high-arity orchestration signatures via borrow-structs
(`AskRequest`/`AskContext` for `handle_ask`, `ConversationLoopCtx` for
`run_conversation_loop`), deleting the last two `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`
suppressions + two `TODO(M2)` markers — clearing the "7 `TODO(M2)` markers resolved" exit
criterion. Executor commit `7edabde`; review approval `67a4d78`.

**M3 phase-08 — help-and-truncation is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Added
ellipsis truncation markers on silent truncation (status bar / panel / committed text) and
completed the `/help` text (aliases, document redirect + tool-output cap). Executor commit
`66b6654`.

**M3 phase-07 — split-webhook is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Split the
1210-line `webhook.rs` grab-bag into a `webhook/` directory module with three cohesive
submodules (`parse` / `process` / `server`) via the M2 C5-split idiom; glob re-exports keep
every `crate::webhook::<name>` path resolving, zero consumer edits. Only non-move edit:
`AlertStatus::as_str` `fn` → `pub(crate) fn`. Executor commit `d8aba17`; review approval `e125eae`.

**M3 phase-06 — error-hardening is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Three
behavior-preserving hardening edits: `memory_prompt.rs` double-lookup → single Entry-API
expression; four `ai/mod.rs` circuit-breaker lock sites → documented `.unwrap_or_log()`
invariant (ERROR-on-poison logging); five `daemon/scheduled.rs` swallowed `notify_tx` sends →
`log::debug!` on dropped receiver. Executor commit `e7a1658`; review approval `b040651`.

**M3 phase-05 — consolidate-leaf-params is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28).
Introduced per-function borrow-structs (`UpdateMemoryArgs`, `SaveSessionArgs`, `RunEditArgs`,
`UpdateMemoryRequest`, `CreateAgentArgs`) resolving 5 of the 7 `TODO(M2)` markers and deleting
their `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` suppressions. Executor commit `822ba7f`; review
approval `e89255e`.

**M3 phase-04 — error-message-quality is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Killed the
`render_error` `{:?}` debug-dump leak via an exhaustive `Response::kind()` label method + a pure
`error_line()` formatter (`unexpected reply from daemon (<Kind>)`), and normalized the
`/session list` + `/prompt` empty-state strings. Executor commit `77ee226`; review approval `1b9d22f`.

**M3 phase-03 — split-utils is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-28). Split the 1007-line
`src/daemon/utils.rs` grab-bag into a `daemon/utils/` directory of cohesive submodules with
`pub use <submod>::*;` re-exports preserving every `crate::daemon::utils::<name>` path. Executor
commit `bc4b76f`; review approval `4a69f1e`.

**M3 phase-02 — approval-prompt-consistency is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-27).
Unified the three interactive approval prompts through a shared `build_approval_prompt()`
builder, canonicalizing on `[Y]es [A]pprove for <label> [N]o`. Executor commit `d4097a6`;
review approval `5726f15`.

**M3 phase-01 — fix-test-hermeticity is `done`** (approved_first_try, 2026-06-27). Converted the
racy `webhook_alert_to_event_log` to a sync `#[test]` driving its one async call via `rt.block_on`
(holds `TEST_HOME_LOCK` for the whole body, restores `HOME`), and added `HOME` capture/restore to
the five leak tests. Executor commit `c52608f`; review approval `ce7c650`. 15× concurrency soak clean.

**M2 — TUI Renderer Overhaul is complete** (2026-06-27; all 16 phases `done`). Retrospective in
`docs/dev/milestones/M2-tui-renderer/README.md`. The M2 calibration fold (front-loading made
task-shape-conditional + milestone-gate clarification) landed in WORKFLOW.md (commit `70e9712`).

**M1 — Agent Tooling Improvements is complete** — all eleven phases `done`; retrospective in
`docs/dev/milestones/M1-agent-tooling/README.md`.
