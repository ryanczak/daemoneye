**Active milestone: M26 — Agent isolation on Docker Sandboxes (sbx)**,
[`milestones/M26-sbx-isolation/README.md`](milestones/M26-sbx-isolation/README.md).
Rescoped 2026-10-05 from "tmux removal & 2.0 close" (now **M27**; later
milestones are M28–M30, `docs/design/daemoneye-2.0.md` § 6). **PE signed off
on scope 2026-10-05**, accepting all six recommendations.

**Active phase: none drafted.** Phase 01 (sbx-measure) is **done**
(approved_first_try, 2026-10-05). Next is row **01b — baseline-green**: `master`
fails clippy (4 new 1.97 lints) and one test on pinky (README § "Baseline red
on pinky"). It must land before row 02 is dispatched. `/rexymcp:architect next`
drafts it.

Carried from M23 into M26: the sandboxed ghost in a PTY shell (now sbx, with
in-VM `Ctrl-p`); the `ghost-shell-guide` memory rewrite; pause-vs-deadline
(decided: a pause suspends the deadline). M23's two fold proposals remain on
the calibration queue.
